        Sinterklaasavond(Saint NicholasÂ´ eve) is a tradition celebrated on December 5th in the Netherlands. 

Sinterklaas(Saint Nicholas) and traditionally Zwarte Piet(Black Pete) but nowadays sooty piet are two characters in this tradition, Sinterklaas gives candy to kind kids and Zwarte Piet helps to deliver it. Weeks before the evening Sinterklaas arrives on boat to the town and rides his white horse through the streets. A lot of people usually come to watch. [1]

The kings day
It is celebrated on April 27th every year. On this day the stress becomes flea markets and if you visit you could get a taste of the Netherlands. [2] It was previously known as the queens day until 2013 when Willhelm-Alexander took over the throne. [3]

The Dutch carnival is a yearly festival that takes place during 3 days in February or March. It usually gathers a lot of people. Throughout the days parades with unique floats are displayed. So this can be a fun thing to do if you're visiting the Netherlands around February-March. [4]

Summary, the Netherlands definitely has some fun traditions and of course they have music festivals on the summer but that's not really traditions.
