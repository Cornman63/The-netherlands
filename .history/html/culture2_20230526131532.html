            <p class="start">Dutch usually start their mornings with a simple slice of bread with toppings like cheese, peanut butter or hagelslag (which is a kind of chocolate sprinkles) being common. Lunches look rather similar to their breakfast with it also being a sandwich but it’s usually a bit more filling with different cold cuts and cheeses on it compared to peanut butter and chocolate. As for dinner they usually have a two or three course meal where the appetizer is usually Snert, a pea soup. The main course is usually potatoes with a large portion of vegetables and a small portion of meat and the dessert is made up of pastries and cookies. </p>

            <p>Football is a way of life for a lot of people and it’s clear to see why. The Royal Dutch Football Association was one of the founding members of FIFA and throughout the years the Dutch have gotten three bronze medals in the olympics and appeared in the FIFA finals three times. Their biggest star was Johan Cruyff before he died in March of 2016. </p>
