            <p class="start">Dutch usually start their mornings with a simple slice of bread with toppings like cheese, peanut butter or hagelslag (which is a kind of chocolate sprinkles) being common. Lunches look rather similar to their breakfast with it also being a sandwich but itâ€™s usually a bit more filling with different cold cuts and cheeses on it compared to peanut butter and chocolate. As for dinner they usually have a two or three course meal where the appetizer is usually Snert, a pea soup. The main course is usually potatoes with a large portion of vegetables and a small portion of meat and the dessert is made up of pastries and cookies. </p>
