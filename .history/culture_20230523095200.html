            <h4>Food</h4>

            The Netherlands has a large variety of food. From the syrup wafer stroopwafel to their world famous licorice all the way to their salted herring. The Netherlands has a wide selection of food and snacks for all tastes.
            
            Dutch usually start their mornings with a simple slice of bread with toppings like cheese, peanut butter or hagelslag (which is a kind of chocolate sprinkles) being common. Lunches look rather similar to their breakfast with it also being a sandwich but it’s usually a bit more filling with different cold cuts and cheeses on it compared to peanut butter and chocolate. As for dinner they usually have a two or three course meal where the appetizer is usually Snert, a pea soup. The main course is usually potatoes with a large portion of vegetables and a small portion of meat and the dessert is made up of pastries and cookies. 
            
            Some Dutch snacks are known all over the world like their syrup filled wafer, the stroopwafel and their sweet and salty licorice. Even their wide variety of cheeses like Gouda, Edam and Leyden and their salted herring are known across the world.

            <h4>Sports</h4>

            Sports are a very important part of Dutch culture. Approximately 28% of the population are active in sports clubs and a majority of those who aren’t members are still active in sports in one form or another. The most important sports in the Netherlands are football, cycling and speed skating.

            Football is a way of life for a lot of people and it’s clear to see why. The Royal Dutch Football Association was one of the founding members of FIFA and throughout the years the Dutch have gotten three bronze medals in the olympics and appeared in the FIFA finals three times. Their biggest star was Johan Cruyff before he died in March of 2016. 

            Cycling is also a very popular sport. Whether it be on smooth roads, off trail or track you will always find at least a few Dutch people cycling. They bike virtually everywhere. Cycling started in the 1890s and rose in popularity by the 1900s. The Dutch have had 2 Tour de France winners in Jan Janssen and Joop Zoetemelk.

            Speed skating is by far the most popular sport during winter time. While football and cycling is all the rage during the summer months. Once it turns colder and starts becoming winter then speed skating stands as the reigning king of sports. You can often see loads of people skating around or racing during those months.

            <h4>Social etiquette</h4>

            While the Dutch etiquette mirrors that of most European countries, they still have some quirks that make them stand out like kissing people on the cheek while greeting them, their strict schedules and their oftentimes brutal honesty. 

            In conversation the Dutch greet either by shaking hands or if they’re close then they may kiss that person on the cheek three times (starting with the left cheek). While engaging in conversation most Dutch try to maintain strong eye contact and talk in a very straightforward and honest way. Some people find their straightforwardness to be rude but they simply see it as an “openness” and don’t mean to offend anyone by it. You may also be surprised by how fluent Dutch people are in other languages. A majority of the population is fluent in English and you may see them respond in it if you ask them something.

            Another interesting thing about the Dutch is their schedules. Everything they do revolves around a schedule and they try to follow it strictly. They don’t “simply” stop by someone's home in an afternoon, it has to be planned weeks in advance and both parties have to agree on it.
