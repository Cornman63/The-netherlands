            Food:

            The Netherlands has a large variety of food. From the syrup wafer stroopwafel to their world famous licorice all the way to their salted herring. The Netherlands has a wide selection of food and snacks for all tastes.
            
            Dutch usually start their mornings with a simple slice of bread with toppings like cheese, peanut butter or hagelslag (which is a kind of chocolate sprinkles) being common. Lunches look rather similar to their breakfast with it also being a sandwich but itâ€™s usually a bit more filling with different cold cuts and cheeses on it compared to peanut butter and chocolate. As for dinner they usually have a two or three course meal where the appetizer is usually Snert, a pea soup. The main course is usually potatoes with a large portion of vegetables and a small portion of meat and the dessert is made up of pastries and cookies. 
            
            Some Dutch snacks are known all over the world like their syrup filled wafer, the stroopwafel and their sweet and salty licorice. Even their wide variety of cheeses like Gouda, Edam and Leyden and their salted herring are known across the world.
