        Picture this: the Netherlands has a long and interesting history. It goes way back, starting with those ancient Germanic tribes who ruled the roost. Along the way, it got influenced by all sorts of folks like the Romans, Franks, and Vikings. But things really hit the fan during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th century. That's when they were on fire with trade and art, leaving behind some seriously cool canal houses in Amsterdam and fancy government buildings in The Hague.
